## Technologies Used

- CSS
- JavaScript

## Styling

The game is styled using custom CSS to create a visually appealing interface. The background color, font styles, and dice images contribute to the overall look and feel of the game.

## How the Dice Rolls are Determined

The JavaScript function `dice()` generates random numbers between 1 and 6 for each player. The dice images are then updated accordingly. The winner is determined by comparing the rolls.
